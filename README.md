# Risk based programming

Examples for the Risk Based Programming

Potential outcomes of risk areas:
- Unexpected behavior - something that engineering hasn't considered
- Undefined behavior - a behavior that wasn't defined by the engineer
- Inconsistent behavior - a behavior that differs according to other factors (time, threads, network, etc)

Solution to have:
- Clearly defined code that exhibits consistent behavior with every execution.
- This has be established, during:
    - Designing
    - Implementation
    - Testing
    - Validation
